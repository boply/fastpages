### Focus and Habits

- I'm interested in learning a wide variety of skills which is also why I'm taking this APCSA.
- I plan on educating myself more on all my classes so I can not only get better grades but also learn more.
- I'll make sure to manage my mental health and avoid the common trap that students find themselves in.
