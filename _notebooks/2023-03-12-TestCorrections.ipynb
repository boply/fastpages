It's not really a matter of not understanding the material but rather my desire to finish the question in a timely manner.

As we saw throughout this blog I made a lot of silly mistakes that could be realized and overwritten by just taking my time on the questions. Naturally I want to finish the test as soon as possible so making these little mistakes is easy. Going into the real AP MCQ and for really the future of my classes I think it's really important that I take more time on the questions are really understand what it's not only asking but also simple calculations that I could get wrong from rushing."
