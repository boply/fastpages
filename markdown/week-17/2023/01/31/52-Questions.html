<h2 id="question-5">Question 5</h2>

<p>Array with A through L</p>

<p><img width="972" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/215828139-6f700fe7-334d-4916-9f9a-d146f558c30d.png" /></p>

<p>After revisiting this question I can see that instead of d the correct answer is e. I just didn’t know the proper notation for the array syntax. I can now answer this question in the future now that I’ve seen the correct syntax.</p>

<h2 id="question-7">Question 7</h2>

<p>Combine Method</p>

<p><img width="972" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/215826690-10db58a0-a9df-46b7-ae33-3d2a5e509998.png" /></p>

<p>After coming back to this question I can see that instead of c the correct answer is B. This is because I did the last part wrong. I need to take more time on these quizes.</p>

<h2 id="question-19">Question 19</h2>

<p>For loop substring</p>

<p><img width="972" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/215827993-0ad6026e-613a-473e-b6ec-43697c95fc89.png" /></p>

<p>After re-seeing this question, instead of picking E I should’ve picked D. This is because I made the mistake of K starting at 10 instead of 9. This was again a time issue and I’m sure I would’ve gotten it right have I paid more time and attention.</p>

<h2 id="question-37">Question 37</h2>

<p>processWords Method</p>

<p><img width="972" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/215828355-239772d7-a534-42a2-af3e-e9a65c6647ff.png" /></p>

<p>After coming back to this question I can see that the answer is not C but A. This is because I only really looked at the final part rather than the whole thing. This was an overlook on my part but I’m sure I can easily do this if I pay more attention. I was just getting tired of this practice quiz.</p>

<h2 id="question-46">Question 46</h2>

<p>StudentInfo class and averageInMajor method</p>

<p><img width="972" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/215828914-59651667-46ad-451c-a4cd-b329176356ad.png" /></p>

<p>After coming back to this question I can see that rather than C, B is the right answer. I oversaw the answer and instead of using k.getMajor(), I used k.major. This was just me not paying attention towards the end of the test but now I recall the proper notion for future questions.</p>

<h2 id="question-52">Question 52</h2>

<p>X and O board</p>

<p><img width="972" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/215829088-a471bd43-46d6-45db-b13a-4b1afd6ef936.png" /></p>

<p>After re-seeing this question I can see that the answer is E rather than B. I missed the second half of the board for some reason. I can’t even remember what exactly I was thinking when I answered this but now I know it’s wrong. I should be able to get these right in the future.</p>
