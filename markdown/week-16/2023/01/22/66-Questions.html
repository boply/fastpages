<h2 id="question-16">Question 16</h2>

<p>2D Count array columns</p>

<p><img width="969" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/214104925-ac941cac-c90b-4a0c-a85d-09f404399fb0.png" /></p>

<p>After revisiting this question I can see that instead of E the correct answer is C. I just didn’t know the proper notation for the array syntax. I can now answer this question in the future now that I’ve seen the correct syntax.</p>

<h2 id="question-19">Question 19</h2>

<p><img width="969" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/214105098-b840c63d-ee10-4a21-8b7f-2ba2d8bb27c6.png" /></p>

<p>Equivalent Expressions</p>

<p>After coming back to this question I can see that instead of E the correct answer is A. This is because I forgot to include the negative notation on the &amp;&amp; and the first part. This was just a time issue since I was rushing on a weekend quiz.</p>

<h2 id="question-35">Question 35</h2>

<p><img width="969" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/214105272-a0bfd594-d172-48f9-a85e-b15dfed160ee.png" /></p>

<p>For loops that produce the same output</p>

<p>After re-seeing this question, instead of picking E I should’ve picked D. This is because I made the mistake of K starting at 10 instead of 9. This was again a time issue and I’m sure I would’ve gotten it right have I paid more time and attention.</p>

<h2 id="question-37">Question 37</h2>

<p>If and compound boolean equivalence</p>

<p><img width="969" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/214105473-60dc62ad-7982-4e3e-877b-3563ec149fd4.png" /></p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>After coming back to this question I can see that the answer is not D but E. This is because I didn’t use an</td>
      <td> </td>
      <td>statement separating the two expressions and instead used and &amp;&amp;. This was an overlook on my part but I’m sure I can easily do this if I pay more attention.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="question-41">Question 41</h2>

<p>Mystery call to get 11</p>

<p><img width="969" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/214105619-4e794d4d-b8fe-49bc-9998-c07571f31877.png" /></p>

<p>After coming back to this question I can see that rather than C, B is the right answer. This is because I reversed all the trues and false for whatever reason. I can do this question in the future as I guess I lost my train of thought somewhere between answering and putting down the answer.</p>

<h2 id="question-50">Question 50</h2>

<p>PrintSome method</p>

<p><img width="969" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/214105751-53b92c2c-803f-4f5a-af9e-d5d40e8e6875.png" /></p>

<p>After re-seeing this question I can see that the answer is D rather than C. This is because I didn’t see that the 10 would be divided by two. This was not a lack of knowledge however but just a minor mistake. I can fix this going through the future by rereading the question multiple times to be sure I have the right answer.</p>

<h2 id="question-66">Question 66</h2>

<p>Which while loop equivalent to for loop</p>

<p><img width="969" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/214105861-b260d2a2-8788-4f28-a620-e4b4104fa66a.png" /></p>

<p>After revisiting this question I can see that the answer is B rather than C. This is because I not only added two to the J first but also included 10 rather than just stopping at 10. This will be easy to fix in the future as I need to know that it runs an extra time when you use an equal sign.</p>
