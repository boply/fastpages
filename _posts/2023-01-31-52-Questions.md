# Revisions

## Question 5

Array with A through L

After revisiting this question I can see that instead of d the correct answer is e. I just didn't know the proper notation for the array syntax. I can now answer this question in the future now that I've seen the correct syntax. 

## Question 7

Combine Method

After coming back to this question I can see that instead of c the correct answer is B. This is because I did the last part wrong. I need to take more time on these quizes. 

## Question 19

For loop substring

After re-seeing this question, instead of picking E I should've picked D. This is because I made the mistake of K starting at 10 instead of 9. This was again a time issue and I'm sure I would've gotten it right have I paid more time and attention. 

## Question 37

processWords Method

After coming back to this question I can see that the answer is not C but A. This is because I only really looked at the final part rather than the whole thing. This was an overlook on my part but I'm sure I can easily do this if I pay more attention. I was just getting tired of this practice quiz.

## Question 46

StudentInfo class and averageInMajor method

<img width="972" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/215828914-59651667-46ad-451c-a4cd-b329176356ad.png">

After coming back to this question I can see that rather than C, B is the right answer. I oversaw the answer and instead of using k.getMajor(), I used k.major. This was just me not paying attention towards the end of the test but now I recall the proper notion for future questions.

## Question 52

X and O board

After re-seeing this question I can see that the answer is E rather than B. I missed the second half of the board for some reason. I can't even remember what exactly I was thinking when I answered this but now I know it's wrong. I should be able to get these right in the future.
