# College Board and PBL
Each student captures information in fastpages thinking ... how they are going to capture information that will grow to 10 college board units ... how they will recognize something as PBL vs College Board. 

 1. **I will** watch video from College Board.
 2. **I will** practice fastpages whenever I have the time.
 3. **I will** keep key info and code in Jupyter Notebooks. [Notes Template](https://boply.github.io/fastpages/jupyter/2022/08/28/Template-Notebook-1.html)
