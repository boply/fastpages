## Question 16

2D Count array columns

After revisiting this question I can see that instead of E the correct answer is C. I just didn't know the proper notation for the array syntax. I can now answer this question in the future now that I've seen the correct syntax. 

## Question 19

Equivalent Expressions

After coming back to this question I can see that instead of E the correct answer is A. This is because I forgot to include the negative notation on the && and the first part. This was just a time issue since I was rushing on a weekend quiz. 

## Question 35

For loops that produce the same output

After re-seeing this question, instead of picking E I should've picked D. This is because I made the mistake of K starting at 10 instead of 9. This was again a time issue and I'm sure I would've gotten it right have I paid more time and attention. 

## Question 37

If and compound boolean equivalence

After coming back to this question I can see that the answer is not D but E. This is because I didn't use an || statement separating the two expressions and instead used and &&. This was an overlook on my part but I'm sure I can easily do this if I pay more attention. 

## Question 41

Mystery call to get 11

<img width="969" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/214105619-4e794d4d-b8fe-49bc-9998-c07571f31877.png">

After coming back to this question I can see that rather than C, B is the right answer. This is because I reversed all the trues and false for whatever reason. I can do this question in the future as I guess I lost my train of thought somewhere between answering and putting down the answer. 

## Question 50 

PrintSome method

<img width="969" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/214105751-53b92c2c-803f-4f5a-af9e-d5d40e8e6875.png">

After re-seeing this question I can see that the answer is D rather than C. This is because I didn't see that the 10 would be divided by two. This was not a lack of knowledge however but just a minor mistake. I can fix this going through the future by rereading the question multiple times to be sure I have the right answer.

## Question 66

Which while loop equivalent to for loop

<img width="969" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101087311/214105861-b260d2a2-8788-4f28-a620-e4b4104fa66a.png">

After revisiting this question I can see that the answer is B rather than C. This is because I not only added two to the J first but also included 10 rather than just stopping at 10. This will be easy to fix in the future as I need to know that it runs an extra time when you use an equal sign.
